"HandTrackingModule" 
**Hand Tracking Module with OpenCV and MediaPipe
This project implements a real-time hand tracking system using OpenCV for image processing and MediaPipe for hand detection and tracking. The system captures video input from a webcam, detects hands, and identifies their landmarks, providing visual feedback by drawing the detected landmarks on the video frames. The core functionality is encapsulated in a handDetector class, which includes methods for detecting hands and retrieving the positions of hand landmarks.
